### Wikipedia Wikiracer: Optimized Pathfinding on a Large-Scale Graph
In this project, I implemented a graph search engine on Wikipedia’s hyperlink network to efficiently navigate between two pages in the shortest possible path. The problem was modeled as a graph traversal challenge, where Wikipedia articles serve as nodes and hyperlinks as directed edges.

# Key Achievements:
- Graph Search Algorithms: Developed and optimized Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dijkstra’s Algorithm to explore Wikipedia’s link graph.
- Efficient Web Parsing: Engineered an HTML parser to extract valid Wikipedia links while filtering out irrelevant or cyclic paths.
- Heuristic Optimization for Wikiracing: Designed an intelligent pathfinding strategy that prioritizes promising links (e.g., those lexically close to the goal page or commonly appearing across Wikipedia).
- Caching for Scalability: Implemented an efficient caching mechanism to reduce redundant webpage downloads, significantly improving search speed.
- Potential Applications: This project highlights skills in web scraping, natural language processing, and pathfinding optimization—techniques applicable to recommendation systems, search engines, and large-scale knowledge graphs.

# Impact:
The project demonstrates my ability to apply graph algorithms in real-world scenarios, optimize search heuristics, and work with large-scale, dynamic datasets. These skills are directly relevant to data science roles involving knowledge graph analysis, search ranking algorithms, and AI-driven recommendations.
